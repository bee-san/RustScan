```
Status: PASSED (warnings acceptable)
Issues: Only minor style suggestions and documentation warnings
Critical Issues: 0
Blocking Issues: 0
```

**Identified Improvements (Non-blocking):**
- 10 minor style suggestions in tests (needless borrows, redundant closures)
- 29 missing documentation warnings on internal/private functions
- 1 unused import warning

All issues are cosmetic and do not impact functionality or security.

### 4. Security Validation

#### Cargo Audit Results
```
Status: PASSED
Vulnerabilities: 0 critical, 0 high, 0 medium, 0 low
Warnings: 2 unmaintained dependencies (acceptable)
```

**Dependency Security:**
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities detected
- ⚠️  `ansi_term` v0.12.1 - unmaintained (low impact, terminal styling only)
- ⚠️  `async-std` v1.13.2 - discontinued (acceptable, stable version)

**Security Assessment:** The codebase demonstrates good security practices with no exploitable vulnerabilities identified.
